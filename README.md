I am a junior web designer and front-end developer.

Iâ€™m interested in perfecting my skills in interactions design, JavaScript animations and WebGL/HTML integration.

My background is in music, having been a songwriter, a music producer, an electronic music composer and a sound designer specialized in video-games interactive sound.
This focus on time and the hearing process is a big influence on my web projects.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a couple web projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to make visuals using JavaScript.
